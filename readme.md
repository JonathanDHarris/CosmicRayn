Do you enjoy listening to rain as white noise?

This app plays rain as white noise, but it also streams cosmic ray measurements from the [Athens Neutron Monitoring Station](http://cosray.phys.uoa.gr), and uses the intensity of cosmic rays falling on the Earth to set the volume of the rain.  Cosmic Rayn, if you will.

There is also a non-streaming option using a pre-loaded file of cosmic ray data.
